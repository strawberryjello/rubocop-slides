#+Title: Rubocop - Ruby Static Code Analyzer
#+Babel: :results silent

* Rubocop
- Rubocop is an automated tool that examines Ruby code and checks it against a set of coding conventions
  
- By default, the conventions are based on the Ruby Style Guide by Bozhidar Batsov (https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)

* Installation
#+begin_src ruby
  gem install rubocop
#+end_src

Source and documentation: https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop

For Bundler installation, don't require the Rubocop gem:

#+begin_src ruby
  gem 'rubocop', require: false
#+end_src

* Basic usage
#+begin_src ruby
  rubocop source.rb
#+end_src

Multiple filenames and directories, separated by spaces, can be specified:
#+begin_src ruby
  rubocop app lib/foo.rb
#+end_src

Running =rubocop= without filenames or directories will check all files in the current directory

* Customization
- Rubocop checks are called 'cops'

- Cop behavior can be configured in =.rubocop.yml=, which you can place in the root directory of your project
